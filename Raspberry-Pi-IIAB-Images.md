# Raspberry Pi Images

Author: Tim Moody; Last Updated: Mar 16, 2019

You can find a growing number of prebuilt IIAB images on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/internetinabox). This page provides a select few to help navigate through the Internet Archive site. The images divide into two broad categories, **Generic** and **Specific Curations**.

## Generic IIAB Images

The generic images are simply prebuilt versions of what you could build yourself with [curl scripts at download.iiab.io](http://download.iiab.io/). Instead of downloading a raspbian image, writing it to an sdcard, and running the curl script, you just download one of these images, write it to the sdcard and boot IIAB.

These images are all **'Content Ready'**, that is they have a given set of services installed but no ZIMS, or OER2Go modules, or any other content.
