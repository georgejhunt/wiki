### DRAFT

As our release quickly approaches during the middle of 2017, please see http://wiki.iiab.io/6.3 and http://download.iiab.io/6.3 to try out some dramatic improvements, including an entirely new Kiwix engine, fixing the notorious Chrome bug while also better supporting full-text searching across old ZIM files *and* new ZIM files both!

As of early June 2017, Tech Docs have now officially moved to: https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki

Broader docs for educators/implementers/operators reside at: http://FAQ.IIAB.IO
