### DRAFT

Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) 6.3 is expected in mid July of 2017, including dramatic improvements for educator/implementer communities &mdash; like an entirely new Kiwix engine, fixing the notorious Chrome bug &mdash; while also better supporting full-text searching across old ZIM files *and* new ZIM files both.

IIAB 6.3 now runs on Ubuntu, as well as Raspbian (on Raspberry Pi) and several other Linux distributions like CentOS and Debian!

Pre-release versions of IIAB 6.3 have already been brought to Ghana, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Nicaragua and Malaysia &mdash; while implementation work is currently ongoing for Lebanon.  We're very honored that IIAB 6.3 is increasingly used in medical education (post-secondary and clinical contexts) as well as for children's primary and secondary education!

Please see [download.iiab.io/6.3](http://download.iiab.io/6.3) to try out some of these dramatic improvements, to install/build your own digital library &mdash; and also [wiki.iiab.io/6.3](http://wiki.iiab.io/6.3) to learn about our new rapid boot and friendly poweroff techniques &mdash; essential for low-electricity environments.

Among the suite of server apps you can choose from, a new version of WordPress (4.8) is included.  IIAB 6.3 also brings a much-anticipated transition from ownCloud to [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) broadly backed by free and open-source communities.

Internally, Internet-in-a-Box Tech Docs underwent significant revision as they moved from [github.com/xsce](https://github.com/xsce) to [github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki) -- just as Offline IT Docs (and their internal links) continue to improve at [box/info](http://box/info)

Our code (software) made the big move from [github.com/xsce](https://github.com/xsce) to [github.com/iiab](http://github.com/iiab) honoring our new name (Internet in a Box) with extensive internal "iiab" naming changes put in place (to avoid confusion with legacy "xsce" and "xs" naming conventions) as we enter our 2nd decade with a new generation of contributors jumping in to engage!
