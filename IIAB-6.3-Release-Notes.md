Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) 6.3 was released July 17, 2017, including dramatic improvements for educator/implementer communities &mdash; like an entirely new Kiwix engine, fixing the notorious [Chrome bug](https://github.com/kiwix/tools/issues/1) &mdash; while also better supporting full-text searching across old ZIM files *and* new ZIM files both.

Pre-release versions of IIAB 6.3 have already been brought to Ghana, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Nicaragua and Malaysia &mdash; while implementation work is currently ongoing for Lebanon.  We're very honored that IIAB 6.3 is increasingly used in medical education (post-secondary and clinical contexts) as well as for children's primary and secondary education!

IIAB 6.3 now runs on Ubuntu, as well as Raspbian (on Raspberry Pi) and several other Linux distributions like CentOS and Debian!  Read [IIAB Platforms](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms) and [FAQ.IIAB.IO](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ) as our community documentation is beefed up for educators and implementers/operators offline (http://box/info) and online both.  Internally, Internet-in-a-Box Tech Docs underwent significant revision as they moved from [github.com/xsce](https://github.com/xsce) to [github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki).

Likewise our code (software) made the big move from [github.com/xsce](https://github.com/xsce) to [github.com/iiab](http://github.com/iiab) honoring our new name (Internet in a Box) with extensive internal "iiab" naming changes put in place (to avoid confusion with legacy "xsce" and "xs" naming conventions!)  In support of a new generation of contributors jumping in to engage, as we're about to enter our 2nd decade!

Among the suite of server apps you can choose from, a new version of WordPress (4.8) is included.  IIAB 6.3 also brings a much-anticipated transition from ownCloud to [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) strongly backed by free and open-source communities &mdash; as well as new rapid boot and friendly poweroff techniques &mdash; essential for medical and low-electricity environments :)

Give it a shot!  Installing onto [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) on Raspberry Pi 3 is as easy as running this 1-line command:

`curl download.iiab.io/6.3/rpi/load.txt | sudo bash`

For other install approaches regular laptops or larger servers, please see [download.iiab.io/6.3](http://download.iiab.io/6.3) and also [wiki.iiab.io/6.3](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/6.3) to try out some of these dramatic improvements, to install and build your very own digital library!
