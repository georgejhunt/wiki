### What's New? (TENTATIVE)

* Copy Internet-in-a-Box Content Packs to (and from) USB sticks and portable disks.  If teachers' own ZIM files on a USB stick can be hot-plugged into Internet-in-a-Box, that might be supported in future too.  <sub><sub>[#828](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/828)</sub></sub>
* [Lokole 0.1.26](https://ascoderu.ca/) email for rural communities, students and teachers.  <sub><sub>[PR #1305](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1305)</sub></sub>
* Experimental Captive Portal for new users who have trouble typing in http://box, http://box.lan and http://172.18.96.1 &mdash; to help get everyone started right away &mdash; even if they are not familiar with Latin-based keyboards.  Includes [dnsmasq](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/vars/local_vars_medium.yml#L51-L60) by default, to improve DNS and DHCP, instead of named/BIND and dhcpd.  Please help us test this on different smartphones!  Implementer docs emerging off:  <sub><sub>[#1182](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1182)</sub></sub>
* FUTURE: Node-RED & Mosquitto (MQTT) support for IoT (Internet of Things) electronics projects.  Coming soon in IIAB 7.0?  <sub><sub>[PR #854](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/854)</sub></sub>

### What's Upgraded? (TENTATIVE)

* Internet-in-a-Box's [1-line installer](http://download.iiab.io/6.7/) for Raspbian Stretch, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Debian 9 is ruggedized and more efficient (and can quickly recover if Internet is interrupted during your IIAB installation).  Pick your favorite suite of Internet-in-a-Box apps the very moment you begin: whether you want ~6, ~12 or ~20 apps!  Implementers please read http://FAQ.IIAB.IO to get to know [/etc/iiab/local_vars.yml](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/local_vars.yml) â€” as well as the "[./runrole](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/runrole)" command within IIAB's main directory (/opt/iiab/iiab).
  * This 1-line installer allows setting of passwords for pi and iiab-admin, rapid selection of MIN-sized, MEDIUM-sized or BIG-sized [local_vars.yml](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/local_vars.yml), and automatic installation of apt-based OS updates.  Future: auto-reboot(s) could be made even more intelligent, with better integration/automation of the torrenting+installing of KA Lite compressed videos (etc) across 7 languages.  <sub><sub>[#1028](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1028)</sub></sub>
  * Experimental support for [Debian 10 "Buster"](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) is included, in advance of Debian 10's release in 2019.  Support for [Debian "Sid"](http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/sid_d-i/current/amd64/iso-cd/) (AKA Debian's "unstable" bleeding-edge branch) is also improving.
  * [Ansible 2.7](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides/porting_guide_2.7.html) for Internet-in-a-Box configuration management, explaining its steps during IIAB installation.  <sub><sub>[#1271](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1271)</sub></sub>

### How do I try it?

TL;DR!  Try our 1-line installer for Raspberry Pi 3 (or 3 B+), Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or Debian 9/10:

     curl d.iiab.io/install.txt | sudo bash

On Raspberry Pi, you'll want the latest [Raspbian Stretch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) OS (2018-11-13 or higher) installed onto a microSD card large enough for all your content.  Installation usually completes within two hours, if your Internet speed is very fast.  An actual Ethernet cable greatly helps avoid Wi-Fi glitches!  See [download.iiab.io](http://download.iiab.io/) for speed and security tips to hit the ground running.

Finally if you're adventurous, try installing onto [another Linux](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms), using our [Do Everything from Scratch](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#do-everything-from-scratch) install instructions &mdash; getting you to the most important step &mdash; _where you can [add content!](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#add-content)_
