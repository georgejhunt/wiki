### _**DRAFT**_

Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) 6.7 will build on [IIAB 6.6](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-6.6-Release-Notes), to be released in February 2019 ([Wiki](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/6.7), [GitHub](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/milestone/4)) in service of DIY digital libraries everywhere.

_Consider installing a pre-release today, from <a href=http://download.iiab.io/6.7/>download.iiab.io/6.7</a> !_

### What's New?

* Drag & Drop your favorite Content Packs into position to create the best visual menu for your school or medical clinic's Internet-in-a-Box.  [Screencast videos](http://d.iiab.io/content/videos/) are emerging alongside written [documentation](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Menuing#2019-additions) to help you DIY your own Internet-in-a-Box digital library.  A [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/kananigit/iiab-menu-plugin) is also emerging, so you can integrate IIAB Apps and Content Packs into a larger WordPress site.  <sub><sub>[#1393](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1393)</sub></sub>
* Copy Internet-in-a-Box Content Packs to (and from) USB sticks and portable disks.  If teachers' own ZIM files on a USB stick can be hot-plugged into Internet-in-a-Box, that might be supported in future too.  <sub><sub>[#828](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/828)</sub></sub>
* Experimental Captive Portal for new users who have trouble typing in http://box, http://box.lan and http://172.18.96.1 &mdash; to help everyone get started right away &mdash; even if they're not familiar with Latin-based keyboards.  Includes [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) by default, to improve DNS and DHCP, instead of named/BIND and dhcpd.  Please read [Known Issues](#known-issues) and [help us test this](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#Captive_Portal_Administration:_What_tips_.26_tricks_exist.3F) on different smartphones!  <sub><sub>[#1182](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1182)</sub></sub>
* [Asterisk 16 & FreePBX 15](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/pbx#pbx-readme) for Voice over IP and rural telephony.  Works on Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9 "Stretch" and experimentally supports Raspberry Pi too!  <sub><sub>[PR #1405](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1405)</sub></sub>
* [Lokole 0.1.38](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/lokole#lokole-readme) email for rural communities, students and teachers, with URL _box/lokole_  <sub><sub>[PR #1305](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1305)</sub></sub>
* [Minetest](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/minetest#minetest-readme) is a [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft)-inspired creative/explorational building blocks game, including multiplayer server and additional mods.  <sub><sub>[PR #1471](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1471)</sub></sub>
* [Mosquitto 1.4+ (MQTT)](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/mosquitto#mosquitto-readme) & [Node-RED 0.19.5](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/nodered#nodered-readme) support for IoT (Internet of Things) electronics projects, with URL _box/nodered_  <sub><sub>[PR #1398](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1398)</sub></sub>
* _A brand-new [visual comparison table](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_services_.28IIAB_apps.29_are_suggested_during_installation.3F) helping guide your choice of what services (IIAB Apps) to install._

### What's Upgraded?

* Internet-in-a-Box's (IIAB) [1-line installer](http://download.iiab.io/6.7/) for Raspbian Stretch, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Debian 9 is ruggedized and more efficient (and can quickly recover if Internet is interrupted during your IIAB installation).  [**Pick your favorite suite**](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_services_.28IIAB_apps.29_are_suggested_during_installation.3F) of IIAB apps the very moment you begin: whether you want ~6, ~12 or ~20 apps (MIN-sized, MEDIUM-sized, or BIG-sized).  Implementers please read http://FAQ.IIAB.IO to get to know [/etc/iiab/local_vars.yml](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_is_local_vars.yml_and_how_do_I_customize_it.3F) â€” as well as the "[./runrole](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/runrole)" command within IIAB's main directory (/opt/iiab/iiab).
  * IIAB's 1-line installer encourages you to secure the passwords for 'pi' and 'iiab-admin', offers you a rapid/ selection among MIN-sized, MEDIUM-sized or BIG-sized [local_vars.yml](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/local_vars.yml), then automatically installs apt-based OS updates.  Future: auto-reboot(s) could be made even more intelligent, with better integration/automation of the torrenting+installing of KA Lite compressed videos (etc) across 7 languages.  <sub><sub>[#1028](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1028)</sub></sub>
  * Experimental support for [Debian 10 "Buster"](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) is included, in advance of Debian 10's release in mid-2019 ([install tips](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1387)).  <sub><sub>[#1387](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1387)</sub></sub>  Support for [Debian "Sid"](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable) (AKA Debian's "unstable" bleeding-edge branch) and for [Ubermix](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms#operating-systems) (allowing teachers to wipe PC/workstations clean) are also improving.

### How do I try it?

TL;DR!  Try our 1-line installer for Raspberry Pi 3 (or 3 B+), Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or Debian 9/10.  IIAB's 1-line installer lets you [quickly choose](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_services_.28IIAB_apps.29_are_suggested_during_installation.3F) how much to install: (MIN-sized, MEDIUM-sized or BIG-sized)

     curl d.iiab.io/install.txt | sudo bash

On Raspberry Pi, you'll want the latest [Raspbian Stretch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) OS (2018-11-13 or higher) installed onto a microSD card large enough for all your content.  Installation usually completes within 1-to-3 hours, if your Internet speed is fast.  An actual Ethernet cable greatly helps avoid Wi-Fi glitches!  See [download.iiab.io](http://download.iiab.io/) for speed and security tips to hit the ground running.

Finally if you're adventurous, try installing onto [another Linux](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms), using our [Do Everything from Scratch](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#do-everything-from-scratch) install instructions &mdash; getting you to the most important step &mdash; _where you can [add content!](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#add-content)_

### Known Issues

* [Captive Portal](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#Captive_Portal_Administration:_What_tips_.26_tricks_exist.3F) currently doesn't work if IIAB is installed on OS's other than Raspbian.  Caution: this prototype functionality might not work at all if an Ethernet cable is not simultaneously in use.  <sub><sub>[#1366](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1366)</sub></sub> <sub><sub>[#1504](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1504)</sub></sub>
* If installing IIAB on Debian 10 ("Buster") pre-releases, a few [manual steps](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1387) may be required.  <sub><sub>[#1387](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1387)</sub></sub>
* dnsmasq does not start reliably on Ubuntu 16.04 &mdash; please use [Ubuntu 18.04](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms#operating-systems) instead.  <sub><sub>[#1469](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1469)</sub></sub>
* Kolibri's systemd service sometimes times out (fails to start) during the 1st reboot of IIAB, on Ubuntu 18.04 and possible other OS's too.  As of 2019-02-11, the workaround is to run "systemctl start kolibri" &mdash; or simply to reboot.  <sub><sub>[#1489](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1489)</sub></sub>
* FreePBX (for Asterisk) fails to (re)start intermittently, on Raspberry Pi especially.  <sub><sub>[#1493](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1493)</sub></sub>
* Node.js applications like Asterisk/FreePBX, Node-RED and Sugarizer [won't work](https://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi#swapping-sd-cards) on Raspberry Pi Zero W (ARM6) *if* you installed Node.js while on RPi 3 or 3 B+ (ARM7).  If necessary, run `apt remove nodejs` then `cd /opt/iiab/iiab` then [./runrole nodejs](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/roles/nodejs/tasks/main.yml) _on the Raspberry Pi Zero W itself_ â€” before proceeding to install Asterisk/FreePBX, Node-RED and/or Sugarizer.
