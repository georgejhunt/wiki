## Which Image is Best for Me?

### Raspbian Lite
 
#### Pros
1. Runs best on low powered hardware like the RPi W.
2. Small Size. Does not compete for SD card space with any content which also requries SD card space.
3. Does not compete for memory that might otherwse be used by a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
4. Raspbian supplies a text mode configuration utility (raspi-config) which simplifies many tasks.
#### Cons
1. Configuration requires more knowledge, and more text editing, to set up some of the services.
2. Most computer users are more familiar with the GUI supplied by Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems.
3. New users will find it more difficult to explore what Raspbian offers without a GUI and menus.
