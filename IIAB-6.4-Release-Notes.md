### _**DRAFT**_

Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) 6.4 is expected approximately September 2016.

### What's New?

* Search across across offline (ZIM) content files with an entirely new Kiwix engine under the hood, _watch out Google here we come :-)_
* Support for [Raspbian Stretch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-stretch/) and [Debian 9.1](https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20170722) guaranteeing a solid LTS (long-term support) foundation for years to come.

### What's Upgraded?

* [KA Lite](http://ka-lite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installguide/release_notes.html) (LMS for Khan Academy videos & exercises) is upgraded from Version 0.17.0 to [Version 0.17.2](https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite/releases/tag/v0.17.2) including easy subtitles that are very popular in developing countries.
* Support Expected for [CentOS 7.4](https://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS7.1708) builds on our earlier support for CentOS 7.3 from December 2016.
