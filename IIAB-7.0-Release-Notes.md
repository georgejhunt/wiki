Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) 7.0 was released September 30, 2019.

Use it to "steal" the [Internet's crown jewels](http://internet-in-a-box.org/#quality-content) and craft your own LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA with a $35 Raspberry Pi computer, or any old laptop.

Our [HOW-TO videos](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_technical_documentation_exists.3F) show you how to customize your Internet-in-a-Box "knowledge hotspot" — for your school, your clinic, your library, your entire region — or your very own family.

Install Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) 7.0 using its [1-line installer](http://download.iiab.io/7.0) to transform an old laptop into a "learning palace" for a developing world school, that urgently needs this today!

Then **drag-and-drop** the very best of the World's Free Knowledge (Wikipedia in any language, thousands of Khan Academy videos, zoomable OpenStreetMap, E-Books, WordPress journaling, the new Sugarizer 1.2, Toys from Trash electronics projects, ETC) for those who are burning for learning — but just happen to be offline.

_The crown jewels are all free, liberated — and open source too!  Internet-in-a-Box is now used in schools, libraries and medical clinics in more than 20 countries.  Why not DIY your own LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA with a $35 Raspberry Pi computer, starting today?_

### What's New?

* [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and [Raspbian Buster](https://raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) support, _allowing IIAB installs that are 3X faster!_  IIAB also now supports the brand new [Debian 10 "Buster"](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/) OS, on regular PC's and laptops.
* [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#How_do_I_add_zoomable_maps_for_my_region.3F) is like Google Maps but better, for schools especially, as it works offline and avoids all the advertising.  Implementers can easily download detailed vector-based [Map Packs](http://iiab.me/maps/maplist/) for an entire continent, or the entire world!  Please try it out (after you install IIAB, go to its **http://box.lan/admin > Install Content > Get Map Region**) and [ask us](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_are_the_best_places_for_community_support.3F) about satellite imagery and other mapmaking / map-mixing options _[coming soon.](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Maps#what-might-future-iiab-maps-bring)_  With URL _box/maps_  <sub><sub>[#1710](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1710)</sub></sub>
* [Internet Archive Decentralized Web](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/internetarchive#internet-archive-universal-library--decentralized-web-readme) helps you create your own offline digital library.  It includes a crawler that can regularly synchronize local collections, against a list of Internet Archive items and collections, and those collections can be moved between installations.  When connected to the internet, it works as a Proxy, i.e. it will store Internet Archive content the user views for later offline viewing.  With URL _box:4244 (box/archive in future)_  <sub><sub>[PR #1617](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1617)</sub></sub>
* Beautify your IIAB home page (http://box) with new click-to-install logos for each of your Content Packs & IIAB Apps.  Rewrite any of their descriptions in your own language, also from IIAB's Admin Console (**http://box.lan/admin > Content Menus**) so students know exactly what's available to them, in their own language!  <sub><sub>[#1708](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1708)</sub></sub>
* [Gitea 1.9.3](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/gitea#gitea-readme) ([changelog](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/releases)) lightweight self-hosted "GitHub" version control system, to learn to code collaboratively, with URL _box/gitea_  <sub><sub>[PR #1242](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1242)</sub></sub>
* [AzuraCast 0.9.6.5](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/azuracast#azuracast-readme) is a self-hosted, all-in-one radio station platform.  Use AzuraCast to schedule podcasts, music, and even do live streaming of audio content.  A variety of streaming formats are supported.  <sub><sub>[PR #1733](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1733)</sub></sub>
* Fix the clock's time and date in your IIAB automatically, simply by browsing to your IIAB home page (http://box) using a nearby smartphone or laptop/tablet/computer.  This can be a lifesaver in offline environments, with low-end Raspberry Pi servers that contain no RTC (real-time clock) or coin cell battery.  <sub><sub>[#1680](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1680)</sub></sub>
* [Bluetooth](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/bluetooth) access to IIAB's Admin Console, for IIAB field operators/administrators and advanced teachers too!  You can enable this in [/etc/iiab/local_vars.yml](http://FAQ.IIAB.IO#What_is_local_vars.yml_and_how_do_I_customize_it.3F)  <sub><sub>[PR #1716](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1716)</sub></sub> <sub><sub>[PR iiab/iiab-admin-console#209](https://github.com/iiab/iiab-admin-console/pull/209)</sub></sub>
* [iiab-diagnostics](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/scripts/iiab-diagnostics.README.md) dramatically speeds up remote troubleshooting and community support, so that Internet-in-a-Box Field Teams and Dev Teams can communicate efficiently (while each focusing on what they do best!)  <sub><sub>[#1575](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1575)</sub></sub> <sub><sub>[PR #1763](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1763)</sub></sub>
* Please see ["What might future versions bring?"](#what-might-future-versions-bring)

### What's Upgraded?

* Internet-in-a-Box installation (http://download.iiab.io) is much more self-explanatory, hiding the details of Ansible [2.8](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides/porting_guide_2.8.html) and [2.9](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides/porting_guide_2.9.html) so implementers can focus on [content curation](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#How_do_I_customize_my_Internet-in-a-Box_home_page.3F) instead!  <sub><sub>[#1028](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1028)</sub></sub>
  * If you build your IIAB from a Raspberry Pi, your teachers can now be field-upgrade it without any networking changes at all (even IIAB's with static IP addresses on their Ethernet port!) simply by plugging the IIAB into a live Ethernet port e.g. on the back of a cablemodem or DSL router.  This allows teachers and non-technical operators to carry their IIAB device to a nearby city (e.g. on weekends, or once per semester) to upgrade its content and/or software &mdash; and then re-deploy the IIAB device to the school or clinic where it belongs.
  * Your IIAB's firewall (iptables) and remote connections (OpenVPN) are now much easier to set up in [/etc/iiab/local_vars.yml](http://FAQ.IIAB.IO#What_is_local_vars.yml_and_how_do_I_customize_it.3F)  <sub><sub>[PR #1654](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1654)</sub></sub> <sub><sub>[PR #1677](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1677)</sub></sub>

### Known Issues

* IIAB's home page (http://box) will not display in browsers like Windows 7's Internet Explorer 11.  Please install a modern browser e.g. Firefox or Chrome, as [js-menu](https://github.com/iiab/iiab-admin-console/tree/master/roles/js-menu) requires a more recent version of JavaScript.  <sub><sub>[#1517](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1517)</sub></sub>
* Kolibri blocks you from logging in at times, with its login page infinitely/rapidly looping.  Deleting your browser's cookies is not quite enough to work around this problem, but running your browser in incognito/privacy mode does work.  <sub><sub>[#1532](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1532)</sub></sub>
  * Sometimes Kolibri does not start after reboot, if you've downloaded Kolibri Channels  <sub><sub>[#1648](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1648)</sub></sub>
* When trying to upgrade a Map Pack, Admin Console reports Map Pack as installed when it isn't.  <sub><sub>[iiab/iiab-admin-console#229](https://github.com/iiab/iiab-admin-console/issues/229)</sub></sub>
* Sugarizer generally requires MongoDB, which is no longer packaged by Linux OS's like Debian 10 Buster, due to licensing issues.  <sub><sub>[#1437](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1437)</sub></sub>
* Node.js applications like Asterisk/FreePBX, Node-RED and Sugarizer won't work on Raspberry Pi Zero W (ARMv6) *if* you installed Node.js while on RPi 3 or 3 B+ (ARMv7) or RPi 4 (ARMv8).  If necessary, run `apt remove nodejs` then ([attempt!](https://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi#swapping-sd-cards)) things like `cd /opt/iiab/iiab; ./runrole nodejs` to [install Node.js](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/roles/nodejs/tasks/main.yml) _on the Raspberry Pi Zero W itself_ — before proceeding to install Asterisk/FreePBX, Node-RED and/or Sugarizer.
* A few residual issues remain at: https://github.com/iiab/iiab/milestone/5
