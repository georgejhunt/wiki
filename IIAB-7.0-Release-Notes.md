### About

Internet-in-a-Box brings the [Internet's crown jewels](http://internet-in-a-box.org/#quality-content) and the very best of the World’s Free Knowledge (Wikipedia, Khan Academy, OpenStreetMap, E-Books, etc) to those who are burning for learning — but just happen to be offline.

Use <b>drag-and-drop</b> to customize this "learning hotspot" with local gems too — tailored to the needs of your school, your library, your prison, your region and/or your very own family!

Why not build your own [LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cBGCxr_WPBPa3IqPVEe3g) with a $35 Raspberry Pi computer, starting today?
