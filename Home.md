## Welcome to the Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) Tech Docs Wiki!

The best place to start is [IIAB Installation](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation) which has detailed information on installing the server in several different ways.

You can also read about [IIAB Architecture](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Architecture).

See [IIAB Platforms](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms) for platform-specific information on OS choices and the **partitioning scheme**.

After installation, the Admin Console provides tools for selecting and downloading content. After that is done, you will probably want to provide a [menu or portal](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Menuing) page for direct access to the selected content.

[IIAB Networking](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Networking) summarizes common network setups/topologies and TCP/UDP ports.

Our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) covers broader topics for educators, operators and implementers here: http://FAQ.IIAB.IO
