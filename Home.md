## Welcome to the Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) Tech Docs Wiki!

The best place to start is [IIAB Installation](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation) which has detailed information on installing the server, in several ways.

You can also read about [IIAB Architecture](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Architecture).

See [IIAB Platforms](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms) for platform-specific information on OS choices and the **partitioning scheme**.

After installation, the Admin Console provides tools for selecting server apps and downloading content. After that is done, you will probably want to provide a [friendly home page](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Menuing) for your community.

[IIAB Networking](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Networking) summarizes common network setups/topologies and TCP/UDP ports.

See our Frequently Asked Questions [FAQ.IIAB.IO](http://FAQ.IIAB.IO) for more answers, towards building your very own powerful digital library!

_N.B.: Internet-in-a-Box is a global community project formerly known as the One Laptop Per Child School Server (or XSCE) that greatly [welcomes contributors](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Contributors-Guide) from all continents, all countries, and all corners._
