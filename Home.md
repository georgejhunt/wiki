## Welcome to the Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) Tech Docs Wiki!

[IIAB Installation](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation) details several ways of installing Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB).  Please also see our growing collection of **[HOW-TO videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cBGCxr_WPBPa3IqPVEe3g)**.

An IIAB can be built using an old laptop or PC, but more commonly is built using a "$35" [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) computer.  Here are 2 wonderful guides:

* [Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi-issues/Beginners_Guide_v1.pdf) (1st Edition, 2018, 244 pages, 19 MB)
* [Raspberry Pi User Guide](https://dn.odroid.com/IoT/other_doc.pdf) (4th Edition, 2016, 315 pages, 29 MB)

Read about [IIAB Architecture](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Architecture) for a high-level system view.

See [IIAB Platforms](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms) for OS and hardware choices, as well as the **partitioning scheme**.

[IIAB Networking](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Networking) summarizes common network setups/topologies, TCP/UDP ports and DNS.

After installing IIAB, use the Admin Console (http://box.lan/admin) to refine server apps, download content and arrange a friendly home page (http://box.lan) for your entire community &mdash; as outlined in [IIAB Menuing](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Menuing).

Most IIAB implementers will also want to install [IIAB Maps](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Maps) as suitable for their region or continent.

Finally, see our **Frequently Asked Questions** ([FAQ.IIAB.IO](http://FAQ.IIAB.IO)) to get up-to-date on the very latest techniques, towards building your very own powerful digital library!

**_Internet-in-a-Box is a global community project formerly known as the One Laptop Per Child School Server (or XSCE) that [greatly welcomes contributors](http://internet-in-a-box.org/pages/contributing.html) from all corners of the planet._**
