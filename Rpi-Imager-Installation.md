## Installing RPI-IMAGER
#### Introduction -- Windows, Mac OS, Linux
    Each of the three major Operating Systems has standard methods of adding functions. Raspberry Pi Foundation has developed a package they call **rpi-imager** for each of these main Operating Systems. This page explains the steps that are similar in some respects, but also also particular to each OS.

    For each of the systems, after the normal install process, you can create a file, with the proper contents for your OS, placed in the correcte place, which adds the IIAB images to the ones made available by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

    The first step are the same for each system:
   
    1. Open the browser you normally use,
    1. Click on the following URL https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/.
    1. Download the package for your OS.
    1. The downloads usually go into the same place. But you don't usually need to know where it is, because most browsers offer a "Open in File Manager" (or "Finder") drop down option.
 
#### Windows
    1. In File Manager, double click on the downloaded **rpi-image.exe** file.
    1. On my Windows 10 machine, after there is a new **rpi-imager** icon on the start menu.
