### How do I try it?

TL;DR!  Try our 1-line installer for Raspberry Pi 3:

     curl download.iiab.io/6.5/rpi/load.txt | sudo bash

Be sure your Raspberry Pi 3 is running a recent [Raspbian Stretch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) OS, has a microSD card large enough for content, and is connected to the Internet with an actual Ethernet cable.  Installation usually completes within two hours, if your Internet speed is very fast.  See [download.iiab.io/6.5/rpi](http://download.iiab.io/6.5/rpi/README.html) for other/faster options!

Finally to install onto Ubuntu, Debian or CentOS, use our [Do Everything from Scratch](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#do-everything-from-scratch) install instructions &mdash; which quickly get you to the most important part &mdash; _where you can [add content!](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#add-content)_
